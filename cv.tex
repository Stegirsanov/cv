\section{interests}
I'm an Italian data lover, knowledge addicted, moocoholic and interested in everything student of computer science.
I love data analysis, technology, numbers, models, statistics, inferences, networks, economy, finance, politics, communication, marketing, graphic design, programming, science and many other things.

I do love photography and art in general: my aim is to describe and document life through my personal point of view (and through the lens of my camera).

\section{skills}

Since I developed a huge passion for communication and speaking I've started studying and applying that topics on my own, driven by keen desire of creating the best image for people and things. I've been elected the Student's Delegate for 2 years at the High School Council. I gained pretty good communication ability with the English language thanks to 3 Cultural Exchange with Greek students and the journeys around the world. Since I was 14 I've been an entertainer of a group of young people at the Church Oratory, organizing different activities such as afternoos with children, summer camps, etc. I gave a couple of courses about fundamentals of ICT and Photography.
