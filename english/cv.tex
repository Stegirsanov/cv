\section{interests}
I am a data lover, knowledge addicted and convinced Europeanist. As a skeptical empiricist, I try everyday to make the world better for everyone, keen on figuring out its complexities by proving wrong my previous assumptions. I am certain that political commitment is needed to understand progress implications. I find myself interested in many things, but most of all: web, economy, politics, business, entrepreneurship, society, finance, science, data, technology, numbers, models, art, photography, \emph{philosophy}.
